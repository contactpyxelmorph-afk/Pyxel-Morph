# 🎨 Pyxel Morph

Pyxel Morph is a software tool for **graphic design in game development through GB STUDIO**. It converts your input images into green-shaded previews, helping you quickly map colors into palettes for your game scenes, in addition to a MAPPING FILE and a PALETTE LIST that can be inserted directly into gbstudio. No more need to make a green shaded image from scratch: the app will do that for you.

note: in scene 8 I pasted the palette colors on the color panel rather than the find-closest-hex panel, so colors are a bit mismatched; took 25 minutes to color each image with tile_grid
